# Fish Weight Prediction

Dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/fish-market

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset of fish measurements that can be used to predict the weight of a fish. The dataset includes measurements such as the length, width, and height of the fish.

## Getting Started

To use the fish weight prediction dataset, follow these steps:

1. Download the `fish_weight_prediction.csv` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in a data analysis tool such as Microsoft Excel or R.
3. Use the data to train a machine learning model to predict the weight of a fish based on its measurements.

## Features

The fish weight prediction dataset includes the following features:

- **Length:** The length of the fish, measured from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail.
- **Width:** The width of the fish, measured at its widest point.
- **Height:** The height of the fish, measured from the top of the back to the bottom of the belly.
- **Weight:** The weight of the fish.
- **etc.

## Usage

To use the fish weight prediction dataset, simply import the data into your data analysis tool and use it to train a machine learning model. You can then use this model to make predictions about the weight of a fish based on its measurements.
